## :blush: Foreword:
Thank you for having a glance through my very first and serious IT project in general and Android app project in specific. Even though it's just a simple chat app that you can see and clone everywhere on GitHub (and of course I did have some backup from other sources), I can proudly say that this is still a decent work of mine. So let‚Äôs stop beating around the bush and get to the details:

## :sparkles: Lastword:
I also handled various exceptions throughout the app ‚Äî although it's hard to demonstrate them in screenshots, you‚Äôre welcome to explore the code for more details.

Thank you once again for your attention. I know this project may not be anything special, and my README might still be a bit rough. But the journey of building this app has truly motivated me and sparked a strong desire to grow ‚Äî to one day become a skilled mobile app developer. I sincerely appreciate your time and hope to get feedback from you guys!
