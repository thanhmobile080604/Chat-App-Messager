### Foreword:
Thank you for having a glance through my very first and serious IT project in general and Android app project in specific. Even though it's just a simple chat app that you can see and clone everywhere on GitHub (and of course I did have some backup from other sources), I can proudly say that this is still a decent work of mine. So let’s stop beating around the bush and get to the details:

### 🚀 Technology used:
1. Firestore  
2. Navigation component  
3. Two-way databinding  
4. MVVM architecture  
5. Kotlin Coroutines  
6. Supabase Storage (used instead of Firebase Storage due to cost)

### Lastword:
I also handled various exceptions throughout the app — although it's hard to demonstrate them in screenshots, you’re welcome to explore the code for more details.

Thank you once again for your attention. I know this project may not be anything extraordinary, and my README might still be a bit rough. But the journey of building this app has truly motivated me and sparked a strong desire to grow — to one day become a skilled mobile app developer. I sincerely appreciate your time and hope to get feedback from you guys!
